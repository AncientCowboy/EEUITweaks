EEUITweaks - Version 2.9

This mod is configured as a WeiDU mod and consists of a setup program
named setup-EEUITweaks.exe and a mod files directory named EEUITweaks.
You'll find each of these within the EEUITweaks-master directory with- 
in the zipped archive. Ignore the .gitattributes and .gitignore files -
they are irrelevant to installing/using EEUITweaks.

Note for EET installations: This package has been restructured to work with
EET RC 7.1 (or later) which changed the installation for the optional SoD GUI 
(setup-EET_gui). This version of EEUITweaks will not work reliably with
versions of EET prior to RC 7.1. If you are using the default BG2 gui, 
EEUITweaks should be run after setup-EET_end. If you are using the SoD gui, 
EEUITweaks should be run after setup-EET_gui. In either case, if you want to
switch guis; un-install all EEUITweaks mods first, run setup-EET_gui to install
or remove the SoD gui, and then re-install the desired EEUITweaks mods. 
Basically, the same procedure that is used for any full UI.MENU replacement 
mods in non-EET environments.

To install the mod:

1. Copy setup-EEUITweaks.exe and the EEUITweaks directory tree to your game
   installation directory (contains the chitin.key file)

2. Run setup-EEUITweaks.exe, answering the questions it asks.
   Depending on where your game is installed and the security settings on your
   system, you may need to 'Run as Administrator'. In fact, it's probably a
   good idea just to do it anyway.

That's it! It should install with no problems.

If you do have problems with the install, please message me (AncientCowboy) on
the BeamDog forums and send me a zip (or rar, or ...) containing the DEBUG file
(SETUP-EEUITWEAKS.DEBUG which will be in your install directory) and
a copy of your UI.MENU. From those, I'll be able to sort out the problem.
