EEUITweaks - Version 2.1

This mod is supplied in the form of a WeiDU mod - the contents of the archive
(zip in this case) are placed in the target installation directory, and
a setup program - setup-EEUITweaks.exe - is run to install the mod.

As of version 1.7 it is no longer necessary to pre-extract UI.MENU to your
override directory. WeiDU v240 (packaged as setup-EEUITweaks.exe) will
extract it as necessary.

Note for EET installations: This package has been restructured to work with
EET RC 7.1 which changed the installation for the optional SoD GUI 
(setup-EET_gui). This version of EEUITweaks will not work reliably with
versions of EET prior to RC 7.1. If you are using the default BG2 gui, 
EEUITweaks should be run after setup-EET_end. If you are using the SoD gui, 
EEUITweaks should be run after setup-EET_gui. In either case, if you want to
switch guis; un-install all EEUITweaks mods first, run setup-EET_gui to install
or remove the SoD gui, and then re-install the desired EEUITweaks mods. 
Basically, the same procedure that is used for any full UI.MENU replacement 
mods in non-EET environments. 

To install the mod:

1. Copy setup-EEUITweaks.exe (a renamed copy of WeiDU.exe) and the
   EEUITweaks directory tree to your game installation directory
   (contains the chitin.key file)

2. Run setup-EEUITweaks.exe, answering the questions it asks.
   Depending on where your game is installed and the security settings on your
   system, you may need to 'Run as Administrator'. In fact, it's probably a
   good idea just to do it anyway.

That's it! It should install with no problems. 

If you do have problems with the install, please message me (AncientCowboy) on
the BeamDog forums and send me a zip (or rar, or ...) containing the DEBUG file
(SETUP-EEUITWEAKS.DEBUG which will be in your install directory) and
a copy of your UI.MENU. From those, I'll be able to sort out the problem.
