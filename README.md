# EEUITweaks User Interface Mods Collection Version 2.7

The goal of EEUITweaks is to be a collection of the individual UI.MENU (i.e. Extended Edition 2.x+) mods/patches/tweaks from the BeamDog UI Modding forum; packaged as a single WeiDU collection. The advantages are to automate the tedious manual editing of UI.MENU, simplify multiple mod installations (particularly after an update), and to provide a single source from which many EE GUI mods can be accessed. It does NOT install the full UI replacement environments, although it does support modding them.

EEUITweaks supports BGEE, BG2EE, BGEE/SoD, PST:EE, and EET with the BG2(default) and SoD (EET_gui) user interfaces. It also supports installing mods on the Dragonspear UI++, BG2EE GUI To BGEE, LeUI, Revised Dragon Scale, IWD GUI for BG2:EE and BG:EE, and IWD2 for BG2 replacement UIs. In all cases, it will skip attempting to install useless or invalid mods for a particular environment (e.g. transparent sidebars on Dragonspear UI++).

## Installation

To install the mod:

1. Copy setup-EEUITweaks.exe and the EEUITweaks directory tree to your game
   installation directory (contains the chitin.key file)

2. Run setup-EEUITweaks.exe, answering the questions it asks.
   Depending on where your game is installed and the security settings on your
   system, you may need to 'Run as Administrator'. In fact, it's probably a
   good idea just to do it anyway.

That's it! It should install with no problems.
